## 🗺️ Overworld 🗺️
### Added
* Add OW_DEFOG_FIELD_MOVE to allow players to clear overworld Fog by @pkmnsnfrn in [#6477](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/6477)
    This behavior is enabled by setting `OW_DEFOG_FIELD_MOVE` to `TRUE`.
* Add Time-Based Encounters by @khbsd and @Pawkkie, @Artrios, @GriffinRichards, @ravepossum, @ghoulslash, @lhearachel probably more so tag me somewhere and ill add you! in [#6454](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/6454)
    - Comes with a new conversion script, `wild_encounters_to_header.py`. On my machine i timed it out to about .02s, hopefully it wont add too much to the compile time on anyone elses computers
    - The conversion script can handle an unchanged `wild_encounters.json` just fine, but also plays nice with edited ones as far as I can tell
    - The migration script takes one optional argument, `--copy`
    - `--copy` will copy over all of the encounter tables (`land_mons`, `water_mons`, etc). default behavior just adds the `base_label` and if applicable, the `map`.
* Add B_RUN_TRAINER_BATTLE - players can run from Trainer Battles by @pkmnsnfrn and @wiz1989 [wrote the original feature](https://github.com/TeamAquasHideout/pokeemerald/commit/19c0c32e3718d4fab340cf4f15f29882916a829e). in [#6456](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/6456)
* Integrated merrp's lighting branch (Day/Night System) by @hedara90, @AsparagusEduardo for doing most of this PR and @aarant for the original implementation and feature branch, @Greenphx9 for their help merging to current expansion. in [#6562](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/6562)
    - Changes from the base branch:
    - Uses Expansion's Fake RTC and updates its tinting refresh rate alongside with it.
    - Uses Expansion's constants (`TIME_NIGHT` instead of `TIME_OF_DAY_NIGHT`). This allows it to:
    - Use different tinting for Morning vs Evening compared to the original branch.
    - Use Expansion's `OW_TIMES_OF_DAY`config that allows users to set their own times by generation.
    - Added option to disable object event shadows
    - Added option to turn DNS on or off, `OW_ENABLE_DNS`
    - Added option to for vanilla shadow behaviour, `OW_OBJECT_VANILLA_SHADOWS`
    - Scripts containing consecutive `removeobject <object> and `addobject <object>` needs a `delay 1` between the commands.
    ```diff
    removeobject MY_OBJECT
    + delay 1
    addobject MY_OBJECT
    ```
    - Changes to base Hoenn to integrate DNS can be enabled by reverting commit [a5b079d](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/6562/commits/a5b079d833f18f66ebd53ac77f00227ae4a1f389)
    - Other changes:
    - Changed the BW Map Popup to update its time while active.
* Follower NPCs (follow-me) by @Bivurnum, @ghoulslash Much of their original code is still present. and @grintoul1 Invaluable play testing and feedback. in [#6500](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/6500)
    - Turn any NPC into a follower.
    - Specify a battle partner to turn all trainer battles into multi battles automatically while an NPC follower is present.

### Changed
* Tests for checking all move animations by @hedara90 and @AsparagusEduardo wrote the original tests that I updated in [#6297](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/6297)
    - Set `T_SHOULD_RUN_MOVE_ANIM` to `TRUE` to run these tests, they take a long time to run.
