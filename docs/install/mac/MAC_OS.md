    ```

2.  - If libpng is **not installed**, then go to [Installing libpng (macOS)](#installing-libpng-macos).

### Installing libpng (macOS)
<details>
    <summary><i>Note for advanced users...</i></summary>

>   This guide installs libpng via Homebrew as it is the easiest method, however advanced users can install libpng through other means if they so desire.
</details>

1. Open the Terminal.
2. If Homebrew is not installed, then install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by following the instructions on the website.
3. Run the following command to install libpng.

    ```bash
    brew install libpng
    ```
    libpng is now installed.

    Continue to [Installing pkg-config (macOS)](#installing-pkg-config-macos) if **pkg-config is not installed**. Otherwise, continue to [Installing devkitARM (macOS)](#installing-devkitarm-macos) if **devkitARM is not installed**.

    If both pkg-config and devkitARM are already installed, go to [Choosing where to store pokeemerald-expansion (macOS)](#choosing-where-to-store-pokeemerald-expansion-macos).

### Installing pkg-config (macOS)

1. Open the Terminal.
2. If Homebrew is not installed, then install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by following the instructions on the website.
3. Run the following command to install libpng.

    ```bash
    brew install pkg-config
    ```
    pkg-config is now installed.

    Continue to [Installing devkitARM (macOS)](#installing-devkitarm-macos) if **devkitARM is not installed**, otherwise, go to [Choosing where to store pokeemerald-expansion (macOS)](#choosing-where-to-store-pokeemerald-expansion-macos).

### Installing devkitARM (macOS)
1. Download the `devkitpro-pacman-installer.pkg` package from [here](https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman/releases).
2. Open the package to install devkitPro pacman.
3. In the Terminal, run the following commands to install devkitARM:

    ```bash
    sudo dkp-pacman -Sy
    sudo dkp-pacman -S gba-dev
    sudo dkp-pacman -S devkitarm-rules
    ```

    The command with gba-dev will ask for the selection of packages to install. Just press Enter to install all of them, followed by entering Y to proceed with the installation.

4. After the tools are installed, devkitARM must now be made accessible from anywhere by the system. To do so, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
    echo "export DEVKITPRO=$DEVKITPRO" >> ~/.zshrc
    export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM
    echo "export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITARM" >> ~/.zshrc

    echo "if [ -f ~/.zshrc ]; then . ~/.zshrc; fi" >> ~/.zprofile
    ```
    *Note: Starting with macOS 10.15, the default Unix shell is now zsh. If you migrated from an older version of macOS, you might still be using bash. You can check my running `echo $0` in the terminal.*
    <details>
        <summary><i>If your terminal is using bash instead of zsh...</i></summary>

    ```bash
    export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
    echo "export DEVKITPRO=$DEVKITPRO" >> ~/.bashrc
    export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM
    echo "export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITARM" >> ~/.bashrc

    echo "if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi" >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```
    </details>

### Installing Python (macOS)
1. Download the latest Python package from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
