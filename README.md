# pokeemerald-expansion

### Important: DO NOT use GitHub's "Download Zip" option. Using this option will not download the commit history required to update your expansion version or merge other feature branches. Instead, please read [this guide](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo/wiki/The-Basics-of-GitHub) to learn how to fork the repository and clone locally from there.

## What is pokeemerald-expansion?

pokeemerald-expansion is a decomp hack base project based off pret's [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project. It's recommended that any new projects that plan on using it, to clone this repository instead of pret's vanilla repository, as we regurlarly incorporate pret's documentation changes. This is ***NOT*** a standalone romhack, and as such, most features will be unavailable and/or unbalanced if played as is.

## Using pokeemerald-expansion

If you use pokeemerald-expansion in your hack, please add RHH (Rom Hacking Hideout) to your credits list. Optionally, you can list the version used, so it can help players know what features to expect.
You can phrase it as the following:
```
Based off RHH's pokeemerald-expansion 1.10.0 https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/
```

Please follow the instructions in `INSTALL.md` to get pokeemerald-expansion set up on your machine.

### [Documentation on features can be found here](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/wiki)

## If I already have a project based on regular pokeemerald, can I use pokeemerald-expansion?
Yes! Keep in mind that we keep up with pret's documentation of pokeemerald, which means that if your project a bit old, you might get merge conflicts that you need to solve manually.
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH master`.

With this, you'll get the latest version of pokeemerald-expansion, plus a couple of bugfixes that haven't been released into the next patch version :)

## **How do I update my version of pokeemerald-expansion?**
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Check your current version.
    - You can check in the debug menu's `Utilities -> Expansion Version` option.
    - If the option is not available, you possibly have version 1.6.2 or older. In that case, please check the [changelogs](CHANGELOG.md) to determine your version based on the features available on your repository.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH expansion/X.Y.Z`, replacing X, Y and Z with the digits of the respective version you want to update to (eg, to update to 1.10.0, use `git pull RHH expansion/1.10.0`).
    - ***Important:*** If you are several versions behind, we recommend updating one minor version at a time, skipping directly to the latest patch version (eg, 1.5.3 -> 1.6.2 -> 1.7.4 and so on)
- Alternatively, you can update to unreleased versions of the expansion.
    - ***master (stable):*** It contains unreleased **bugfixes** that will come in the next patch version. To merge, use `git pull RHH master`.
    - ***upcoming (unstable, with potential bugs):*** It contains unreleased **features** that will come in the next minor version. To merge, use `git pull RHH upcoming`.

## FAQ
### `(followers*)` Q: Where are the config settings?
A: Configuration for the follower system is mostly in [event_objects.h](include/constants/event_objects.h):
```c
// If true, follower pokemon will bob up and down
// during their idle & walking animations
#define OW_MON_BOBBING  TRUE

// If true, adds a small amount of overhead
// to OW code so that large (48x48, 64x64) OWs
// will display correctly under bridges, etc.
#define LARGE_OW_SUPPORT TRUE
```

### `(lighting)` Q: How do I mark certain colors in a palette as light-blended?
A: Create a `.pla` file in the same folder as the `.pal` with the same name.

In this file you can enter color indices [0,15]
on separate lines to mark those colors as being light-blended, i.e:

`06.pla:`
```
# A comment
0 # if color 0 is listed, uses it to blend with instead of the default!
1
9
10
```

You might have to `make mostlyclean` or change the `.pal` file to pick up the changes.
